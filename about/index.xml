      <description>My name is Sergio Garcia. I was born on june, 1977, in Bogota, Colombia. I love programming, an activity that never ceases to amaze me.

It&amp;#8217;s a little like science, mathematics, engineering, a little like art, architecture, writing, horticulture, and a lot like a long, unplanned journey.</description>
